## Running the Next.js project

The Next.js application lives inside the `frontend` folder. You can use either
Yarn or npm to install dependencies and run the project.

### Using npm

```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # install dependencies
npm run dev           # start development server
npm run build         # build for production
npm start             # run the production server
```

### Using Yarn

```bash
cd frontend
yarn                  # install dependencies
yarn dev              # start development server
yarn build            # build for production
yarn start            # run the production server
```

Both methods produce the same result; choose whichever tool you prefer.
